Overview
========

377616 messages from 9475 geo-located microblog users approximately within the
United States, over one week in March 2010.  See the 'Data' section of the
paper for more details.


Contents
========

full_text.txt   --  All messages and meta information, in tab-separated fields.

processed_data/
  data.mat      --  Matlab format.  Key variables are
    w_data         -- (User ID, "document position", word ID) triples
    u_lat, u_long  -- Coordinates per user.

  Main plaintext-formatted data:
  user_info     --  Geo coordinates per user (from their first message)
                    User IDs correspond to line numbers in this file.
  vocab_wc_dc   --  Vocabulary file, with word and doc counts. 
                    Word IDs correspond to line numbers in this file.
  user_pos_word --  (User ID, docposition, word ID) triples

  Other versions:
  user_word_tf  --  Normalized TF features per user, triples format.
  {train,dev,test}.dat  --  Word counts per user, "LDA" format.

preproc/        --  Scripts for constructing some of the above files
                    from full_text.txt.

geo_eval/       --  Scripts we used for location prediction evaluation.
                    A little messy; not all are used.
                    geo_dist.py is the most (only?) useful one.

"Document position" means the position in the document obtained from
concatenating all the user's messages together.

Train/Dev/Test splits
=====================

Train, Dev, and Test splits are by user ID.
Folds are numbered 1,2,3,4,5, 1,2,3,4,5, across users
  i.e., fold = (userID % 5); fold = fold==0 ? 5 : fold  

Training set is folds 1,2,3
Dev set is fold 4
Test set is fold 5

Some files already have train,dev,test splitted versions.


De-identification
=================

All messages were public Twitter messages posted in March 2010.

Even so, we have taken an additional, if modest, step of anonymizing usernames
in the author field as well as @-mentions.  This certainly does not ensure
privacy, but makes casual searching for individual users a little harder.
